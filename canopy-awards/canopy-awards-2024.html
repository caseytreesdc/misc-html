The Canopy Awards are Casey Tree's flagship fundraising event and annual celebration of trees - a time when we recognize the vital role trees play in our communities and the world. It is also Casey Trees’ unique way of honoring the people and partners working to restore, enhance, and protect DC’s tree canopy. Held each year around Arbor Day, Casey Trees comes together with donors, volunteers, sponsors, and partners – to toast the accomplishments of our distinguished honorees and celebrate our shared tree canopy.

<h2>Honoree Categories</h2>
We will announce our incredible honorees very soon, check back here to see them!

<strong>Partnership</strong> - <span style="font-weight: 400;">This award recognizes a neighborhood, community group, funder or other group that has worked with us to improve the tree canopy in a specific location in the DC metro area. Our canopy needs a patchwork of partners so previous winners run the gamut from single citizens, to bands of community members, and even citywide agencies. These are Trees for Georgetown, Carol Herwig, The Crispus Attucks Development Corporation, Douglas Solomon and Shake Shack Union Station, the DC Department of Parks and Recreation and DC Department of Housing and Community Development, Anacostia Riverkeepers, and Friends of Oxon Run.</span>

<strong>Volunteer Service</strong> - Volunteers are the backbone of Casey Trees. We’d be lost without them. Especially our volunteers that have been involved for season after season. We rely on their accumulated expertise and friendly spirits to help us train the next cohort of volunteers. Our Canopy Award for Volunteer Service recognizes an individual who has consistently supported our programs and goals through volunteerism for five or more years. Past winners include everyone from tree planting pros, pruning experts, inventory leads, and seasoned tree advocates like Christy Kwan, Andrea Moreland, Gregg Serenbetz, Kerrin and Greg Nishimura, Kathy Robertson, Delores Bushong, Mary Pat Rowan, and Jack Camino. See our <a href="https://caseytrees.org/2022/04/a-retrospective-on-all-the-canopy-award-for-volunteer-service-honorees/">Leaflet article</a> to read all about the recipients of this awards.

<strong>Leadership</strong> - <span style="font-weight: 400;">Planting and caring for trees is important but one of the best ways to protect them is through getting the word out and policy changes. The Canopy Award for Leadership takes this into account and awards the efforts of an individual to raise awareness in the community about the importance of trees through public action, community activism or policymaking. Previous winners are former mayor Anthony A. Williams, Earl Eutsler and DDOT’s Urban Forestry Division, Tommy Wells and District Department of Energy and the Environment, and Councilmembers Mary C. Cheh, Phil Mendelson, and Charles Allen.</span>

<strong>Education</strong> - <span style="font-weight: 400;">This Canopy Award goes to an active partner of our educational programming showing a dedication to developing opportunities for environmental education. While you might first think of only teachers, think again. Past winners are author and DC tree expert Melanie Choukas-Bradley, extension agent for the University of the District of Columbia Mary Farrah, Capital City Public Charter School Garden Coordinator Ryoko Yamamoto, Horace Mann Elementary Garden Coordinator Amy Jagodnik, DDOT Urban Forestry Division Arborists Steve McKindley-Ward and Joel Conlon, and Kendall Demonstration Elementary School teacher </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heidi Burns, WAMU's Jacob Fenston, and Anacostia High School's Jeria Carter. In their own sphere, each award winner has pushed for the importance and knowledge of power in protecting city trees.</span>

<strong>Sustainability</strong> - <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Award for Sustainability is our opportunity to showcase a particular project that goes above and beyond. This award highlights a development, project, installation, design, project or product/technology that significantly improves DC’s tree canopy. Past winners and projects have varied greatly. These are Oehme van Sweden’s design of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, the District Department of Transportation’s streetscape designs, the DC Office of Planning’s focus on the public parking zone, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Nature Conservancy’s work with Mt. Olivet Cemetery and their stormwater runoff mitigation, DC Water, and most recently, Wayne Lucas of Prince George's County.</span>
