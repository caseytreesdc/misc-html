<h2>The 2023 Canopy Awards</h2>
This year's theme is "A Greater Washington", in recognition of what makes our city great - our volunteers, donors, our DC and regional partners, and of course, our trees.

The Canopy Awards are Casey Trees' unique way of honoring the people and partners working to restore, enhance, and protect DC’s tree canopy. Held each year on Arbor Day, Casey Trees comes together with donors, volunteers, sponsors, and partners - to toast the accomplishments of our distinguished honorees and celebrate DC's trees.

<h2>Introducing our 2023 Honorees</h2>
This year marks the 9th annual Canopy Awards, our unique way of celebrating Arbor Day and honoring the people and partners working to restore, enhance, and protect DC’s tree canopy. We come together each year to toast the accomplishments of our distinguished honorees and celebrate DC’s trees.

This year’s Canopy Awards theme is “A Greater Washington”, in recognition of what makes our city great – our volunteers, donors, our DC and regional partners, and of course, our trees. We work with so many great people and organizations to achieve goals in planting, educating, protecting, and caring for trees – it's our honor to highlight their efforts and achievements.

We are proud to introduce our 2023 Canopy Awards honorees.

Bryant Smith is the Executive Director of Baltimore Tree Trust, a nonprofit organization guided by the singular vision that all Baltimore neighbors deserve access to the clean air and cool green spaces that trees can provide. Baltimore Tree Trust plants trees in parks, on private property, and lining streets throughout neighborhoods all over Baltimore, with over 17,000 trees planted to date. Born and raised in East Baltimore, Bryant joined Baltimore Tree Trust in 2019 after more than three decades in urban forestry with the U.S. Forest Service, Baltimore City Department of Recreation and Parks, and other regional environmental nonprofits. Bryant leads staff, stakeholders, and the organization’s board of directors to effectively execute the organization’s strategic priorities. Bryant says his favorite part of leading at Baltimore Tree Trust is working with dedicated staff, mentoring a new generation of urban foresters, and working with Baltimore residents to transform once tree-less streets, parks, and schools into green spaces for all to enjoy.

<strong>Award for Volunteer Service</strong><strong>: Phil Downey, Volunteer with Laudato Trees<img class="alignright wp-image-24029" src="https://caseytrees.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Philip-Downey-1080px-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></strong>
Phil Downey is the lead volunteer with the Laudato Trees Team, an offshoot of the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington Care for Creation Committee. Inspired by Pope Francis’ encyclical Laudato Si’, The Laudato Trees Team reaches out to faith communities and encourages them to plant trees on their property. They connect interested congregations with Casey Trees' urban foresters, promote dialog about an ideal plan, and then expedite necessary actions to get trees in the ground. Phil’s efforts and persistence have led to the planting of over 600 trees at churches and schools in the last two years. He is the first to say that this achievement reflects the collective effort of many volunteers, pastors, church workers, and Casey Trees' urban foresters; but without Phil’s hard work, dedication, and love for trees, most of these trees would not have been planted.
