Join Casey Trees’ inaugural youth Earth Day Challenge! Schools are invited to showcase trees on their campus and how their school can make a difference to the urban forest. Casey Trees will highlight the best in each category in our Leaflet newsletter. Scroll below to find instructions for each mini challenge.

Participating schools are entered into consideration for a Junior Urban Forester Field Trip with our Education staff! Other prizes include Casey Trees swag, a future tree planting, and more. Each school will be considered for one prize, and winners will be announced in early May.
