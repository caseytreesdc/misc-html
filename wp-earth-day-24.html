<h2 style="margin-top: 80px; text-align: center;"><i>Celebrate Earth Day all month by taking the Earth Day Challenge</i></h2>
Join Casey Trees’ second annual youth Earth Day Challenge! Schools are invited to showcase trees on their campus and how their school can make a difference in caring for the urban forest. Casey Trees will highlight the best in each category in our Leaflet newsletter. Scroll below to find instructions for each mini-challenge and scroll to the bottom of this page for challenge submission. <em>Submissions will be accepted anytime in the month of April.</em>

Participating schools are considered for a class set of our Tree Species Guides! Other prizes include Casey Trees swag, a future tree planting, and more. Each school will be considered for one prize, and winners will be announced in early May.
<h2>Earth Day Challenges</h2>
Participate in the challenge that corresponds to your group’s grade level. Only one submission for each category will win a prize.
